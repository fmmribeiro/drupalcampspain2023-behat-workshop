  So that I can learn about topics related to recipes

  Scenario: See an article in home page

    Given I am an anonymous user
      And I go to "/"
      And I click "View Article"
     Then I should see "Give your oatmeal the ultimate makeover"
     Then I should see "It is vegan, gluten-free, low in fat, high in fiber, and can even lower cholesterol - but oatmeal is boring, right?"
